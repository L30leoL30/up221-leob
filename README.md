## Course Description:
Introduction to python-based approaches to GIS and spatial data science.

## Who I am:
I am a second year MURP with a concentration in design and development. I'm also working towards a data analytics certificate. My main interests are labor and cartography and I am especially eager to apply spatial analyses to strategic union research and organizing. Recently I've sought to incorporate GIS into the research projects I work on at the UCLA Labor Center. Outside of school and work I enjoy digital and film photography and playing rugby. 

## Project ideas: 
Use the Zillow Observed Rent Index to track how rents in different parts of LA change as a result of the recent wildfires. 

Use the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment and wage database to track how employment, wages and total establishments in different industries have changed over time in California. 

## My objectives for the class: 
Gain a working understanding of python and the ability to create presentation-quality maps without using ArcGIS.
